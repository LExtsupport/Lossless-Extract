# Lossless-Extract


Lossless Extract for macOS and Windows is a tool for purists who demand perfect audio preservation. Designed for precision and simplicity, it effortlessly extracts high-resolution audio from Blu-ray, SACD, MKV or DVD=Audio sources. It handles Dolby TrueHD (with Atmos) and DTS-HD Master Audio preserving atmos object based meta data. Many tools decode immersive audio into PCM, which permanently destroys spatial metadata. Lossless Extract preserves the original audio stream so the immersive mix plays correctly on compatible AVRs and streaming devices.

Accepts MKV, BLU-Ray BDMV, and DVD-AUDIO ISO, AUDIO_TS folders, and SACD.isos as input files. Choose your preferred output format—FLAC , MKA, M4A, DSF, DFF, or Direct stream copy and Lossless Extract will deliver pristine, bit-for-bit copies of your original audio streams. Whether you’re archiving your home theater collection or preparing high-end audio projects, Lossless Extract ensures every detail is preserved, every time.
